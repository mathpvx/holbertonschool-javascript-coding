# ES6 Promises Amateur

This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of ES6 promises in JavaScript. Concepts studied are the following: promises, asynchronous programming, and error handling, usage of methods like `then`, `resolve`, and `catch`, handling asynchronous tasks with `await`, and utilizing `async` functions.
